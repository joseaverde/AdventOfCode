 * --- Day 4: Camp Cleanup ---
 *
 * Space needs to be cleared before the last supplies can be unloaded from the
 * ships, and so several Elves have been assigned the job of cleaning up
 * sections of the camp. Every section has a unique ID number, and each Elf is
 * assigned a range of section IDs.
 *
 * However, as some of the Elves compare their section assignments with each
 * other, they've noticed that many of the assignments overlap. To try to
 * quickly find overlaps and reduce duplicated effort, the Elves pair up and
 * make a big list of the section assignments for each pair (your puzzle
 * input).
 *
 * For example, consider the following list of section assignment pairs:
 *
 *       2-4,6-8
 *       2-3,4-5
 *       5-7,7-9
 *       2-8,3-7
 *       6-6,4-6
 *       2-6,4-8
 *
 * For the first few pairs, this list means:
 *
 *  - Within the first pair of Elves, the first Elf was assigned sections 2-4
 *    (sections 2, 3, and 4), while the second Elf was assigned sections 6-8
 *    (sections 6, 7, 8).
 *
 *  - The Elves in the second pair were each assigned two sections.
 *
 *  - The Elves in the third pair were each assigned three sections: one got
 *    sections 5, 6, and 7, while the other also got 7, plus 8 and 9.
 *
 * This example list uses single-digit section IDs to make it easier to draw;
 * your actual list might contain larger numbers. Visually, these pairs of
 * section assignments look like this:
 *
 *       .234.....  2-4
 *       .....678.  6-8
 *
 *       .23......  2-3
 *       ...45....  4-5
 *
 *       ....567..  5-7
 *       ......789  7-9
 *
 *       .2345678.  2-8
 *       ..34567..  3-7
 *
 *       .....6...  6-6
 *       ...456...  4-6
 *
 *       .23456...  2-6
 *       ...45678.  4-8
 *
 * Some of the pairs have noticed that one of their assignments fully contains
 * the other. For example, 2-8 fully contains 3-7, and 6-6 is fully contained
 * by 4-6. In pairs where one assignment fully contains the other, one Elf in
 * the pair would be exclusively
 * cleaning sections their partner will already be cleaning, so these
 * seem like the most in need of reconsideration. In this example,
 * there are 2 such pairs.
 *
 * In how many assignment pairs does one range fully contain the
 * other?
 *
 * --- Part Two ---
 *
 * It seems like there is still quite a bit of duplicate work planned. Instead,
 * the Elves would like to know the number of pairs that overlap at all.
 *
 * In the above example, the first two pairs (2-4,6-8 and 2-3,4-5) don't
 * overlap, while the remaining four pairs (5-7,7-9, 2-8,3-7, 6-6,4-6, and
 * 2-6,4-8) do overlap:
 *
 *  - 5-7,7-9 overlaps in a single section, 7.
 *  - 2-8,3-7 overlaps all of the sections 3 through 7.
 *  - 6-6,4-6 overlaps in a single section, 6.
 *  - 2-6,4-8 overlaps in sections 4, 5, and 6.
 *
 * So, in this example, the number of overlapping assignment pairs is 4.
